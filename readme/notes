reactify was not working well,
so reading these comments ,

Reactify should no longer be used. You don't say what version you are on, but as of Babel 6 "preset's" are the standard way to achieve compilation.

Run the following

npm install save-dev babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015
You should also make sure Babelify is up to date. Then your Gulp config becomes

var babelify = require("babelify");
gulp.task('react', function () {
  browserify('app/src/main.jsx')
    .transform(babelify, {presets: ["es2015", "react"]})
    .bundle()
    .pipe(source('app.js'))
    .pipe(streamify(uglify()))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/js/'));
});
